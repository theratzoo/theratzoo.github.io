            <p>Portable Physicist is a physics application I began working on toward the end of high school. It started as an app for solving kinematics problems, but I expanded it to include other physics concepts and features such as unit conversion and practice problems. The app was launched as an iOS app. However, due to time constrains, I have pulled it from the store for now.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Code Samples</h4>
            <p>Below are some of the source code used in the project. The first code sample comes from the calculator page in the app, handling the different physics calculators such as kinematics, forces, and gravitational force. The second code sample is the equation class, which handles the calculations and does the behind-the-scenes math. The final code sample is the unit converter page's class, which handles the user interacting with that part of the app, calculating and displaying conversions.</p>

            <h4>Screenshots</h4>
            <p>Below are three screenshots from the app. The first is a screenshot from the calculator part of the app. The second comes from the show work feature, which displays the steps to solve a problem that a user calculated. The final screenshot comes from the practice problems feature, which gives the user randomly generated problems based on some settings.</p>
