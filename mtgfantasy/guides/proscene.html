            <h1>About MTG Pro Scene</h1>
            <p>In Magic: the Gathering, the pro-scene refers to the competitive tournaments that include the best Magic players across the world. The pro-scene is divided into two leagues, with three major tournaments for each Standard set release. This guide will go over how the league works to make your MTG Fantasy league structure make more sense.</p>
            <p>Notice: if you have paid attention to the MTG pro-scene in the past (especially before MTG Arena's release), it is still recommended to read this guide, as the competitive structure has changed considerably over the past few years.</p>

                        <p>The MPL, or Magic Pro League, is a group of 24 players who are considered to be the best of the best MTG players. These players compete in all of the major tournaments. The MPL players are chosen at the end of the new season, based on the MPL, Rivals, and Challenger Gauntlets. MPL members who finish low are relegated to the Rivals league or have to compete in the MPL gauntlet to retain their MPL spot.</p>

                        <p>A League Weekend corresponds to an MTG Standard set release. For example, with Strixhaven's recent release, there will be two corresponding League Weekends. There are about eight League Weekends every season. </p>
                        <p>Only MPL and Rivals players compete in League Weekends. Rivals and MPL players each compete in their own separate League Weekend, occurring on the same days and same times.</p>
                        <p>Each League Weekend occurs on both Saturday and Sunday. Points are awarded to MPL and Rivals players based on how many best-of-three matches they win. One point is given for each match win. Matches are distributed more arbitrarily; League Weekends do not follow a structured tournament bracket. There are six matches on Saturday and six more on Sunday, so a maximum of 12 points can be earned each weekend.</p>
                        <p>League Weekends are constructed tournaments. Specifically, the Standard and Historic formats are played. MTG Arena is the platform played on. The games can thus easily be watched on Twitch or another streaming platform.</p>
                        <p><em>Aside: in the past, there were more matches, so past League Weekends may show players with more than 12 points earned.</em></p>

                    <h3>Championships</h3>

                    <summary class="content">
                        <p>Similar to League Weekends, there is one Championship for each MTG Standard set release. Championships occur about a month after the second League Weekend for that Standard set.</p>
                        <p>Unlike League Weekends, a Championship composes of both MPL and Rivals players competing in the same tournament, along with "Challenger" players. A Challenger is someone who qualified for a Championship through other means, such as placing well in a qualifier event on MTG Arena. Thus, a Championship has a lot more players than a League Weekend; usually, upwards of 200 players compete!</p>
                        <p>A Championship is a formal tournament, with several rounds being played before a cut to the top eight occurs. Then, the top eight play until there is a victor. The players who place the highest earn points for their respective leagues (MPL/Rivals), while the best Challenger players earn a spot in a tournament known as a Challenger Gauntlet, where they compete for a spot in the MPL or Rivals League. </p>
                        <p>Championships are constructed tournaments, with decks in either the Standard or Historic format. Championships as of now are played entirely on MTG Arena and can also be viewed on Twitch.</p>
