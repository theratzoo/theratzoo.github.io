            <h1>About MTG Fantasy</h1>
            <p>
                MTG Fantasy is essentially a sports fantasy league website, but for the trading card game Magic: the Gathering! Users create a league with friends and draft pro MTG players and earn points based on how they perform. In addition, MTG Fantasy has articles and guides to help improve one's fantasy experiences.

                    <h3>Creating Draft</h3>
                    <p><em>Notice: only one person per group needs to do this</em>
                    <br>To create a draft, you first need to register for an account or log in if you already have. Then, click the link <a href="draft/createdraft.html">here</a>. Once on that page, you just need to fill out the number of players drafting and then a draft name. Once there, the draft will appear on your account.</p>

                    <h3>Participating in your Fantasy League</h3>
                    <p>The way MTG Fantasy drafts work is, you first select a certain number of players in a draft. The number of players on your team is determined by the number of people participating in your draft.</p>
                    <p>After that, for an MTG season, the players on your team earn you points based on how they participate in a tournament. The better the players place, the more points they earn you. The person who accumulates the most points wins the fantasy league.</p>
                    <p>You may change your players by trading with other people within your fantasy league. All trades must be fair; no collusion is allowed. MTG Fantasy does not have any responsibility for any issues you have in trades, thus it is recommended that each group figures out a concrete list of fair rules to abide by.</p>

                    <h3>MTG Pro Scene Guide</h3>
                    <p>This guide is for those who understand MTG but not the professional scene. Essentially, MTG is like an esports, with several smaller tournaments that lead up to larger competitions. In the current climate, thanks to Covid-19, most tournaments and gameplay have been moved online. As such, the structure has been undergoing a lot of change, making it look a lot more different than a year ago. Thus, this guide is an invaluable tool for understanding the most up-to-date information on the structure of the MTG competitive tournaments and overall bracket.</p>
