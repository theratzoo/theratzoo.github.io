                <h3>Write a Review</h3>
                <p>Writing a quick review on the App Store is a great way to voice your thoughts on Portable Physicist. It is a great way to tell us what we are doing right so we can focus on that section. An App Store review on suggestions also helps our development.</p>

                <h3>Submit Feedback by Email</h3>
                <p>Is an App Store review too small to write out your suggestion? Do you need visuals to supplement the idea you have? If so, feel free to send an email detailing your suggestion. When writing a suggestion as an email or a review, it is best to be as detailed as possible.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Tip: If you want to increase the chances that your suggestion is implemented, get others on board to write reviews or send emails!</p>
