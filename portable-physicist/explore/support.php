                <h3>Share the App</h3>
                <p>The best, free way to support Portable Physicist is to simply share the app around. Whether it is to friends who need help in physics or your physicis professor, we would appreciate it greatly. Portable Physicist is, after all, meant to help others. So sharing the app not only helps us continue developing features, but it also helps your friends and peers learn physics.</p>

                <h3>Write a Review</h3>
                <p>Writing a quick review on the App Store is a great way to support Portable Physicist. Not only does it help the app continue development, but it also tells us what we are doing right and what we can improve on.</p>

                <h3>Becoming a Tester</h3>
                <p>If you are interested in getting more involved, you can become a Beta tester for a future Portable Physicist feature. As a tester, you get early access to the feature and are expected to report bugs and formatting issues when they arise. If you wish to get involved, contact me at my email address found in the contact page.</p>

                <h3>Graphic Artists</h3>
                <p>For this website and the app, graphic artists would be much appreciated. As the app is free as of now, we would request volunteers. Having access to beta versions, getting all future premium features free, and giving your feature requests priority are all benefits that can be discussed. Similar to becoming a tester, please contact me at the email address found in the contact page.</p>
