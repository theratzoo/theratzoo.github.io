                <p>The Practice Problems feature in Portable Physicist is designed to help students get extra practice on Physiscs concepts. Whether to learn a concept or study for a test, Practice Problems allow for a stress-free zone to practice questions. The questions in the Practice Problems feature are customizeable to catear to your individual needs. With an unlimited supply of problems, this distinct feature in Portable Physicist is useful for any Physics learner.</p>

                **can also have a tips and tricks section on how to solve problems, like be in right units and how you do not have to have exact # inputted (can round a little bit)

                    <p>For more in-depth assistance, it is best to save the problem to view it in the Show Work feature. After tapping the save button and entering a title for the question, head over to the Show Work feature and then select that particular problem. You can then view the entirety of the problem, or just parts of it to assist you in figuring out the rest. As long as you did not loose the app session, you will be able to return to that Practice Problem to solve it.</p>

                    <p>Before beginning to calculate values, make sure that you converted the values provided in the problem to their SI (base) units. If you do not know the conversion off hand, the Unit Converter in Portable Physicist is a great tool to get a quick conversion of the values.</p>

                    <h3>Rounding</h3>
                    <p>For Free Response questions, it is not necessary to input the exact answer you calculated. Rounding it a little bit based on the problem will still give a close enough answer to be correct. For example, if the correct answer is 231.591, 231.6 would be acceptable.</p>
