                    <p>The first step for any Physics problem is identifying the variables that have known values and the ones that need to be solved. While the known variables are all available in the question, writing it down separately with its associated value helps visualize the daunting problem. In addition, the variables that will be solved for should be written down separately.</p>

The form you want is to have only the unknown on one side, and all the other variables and constants on the other side. Doing this makes calculation errors less frequent. If you are unsure of how to do the algebra, it is fine to skip this step (but be careful when plugging in the values).</p>

                    <p>Finally, with the answer you retrieved from your calculator, write it down. But before you circle it or input it into Portable Physicist, make sure to include both the units and proper rounding rules. For the former, all that is necessary is putting down the SI (base) units for the given variable. The latter depends on what is asked of you. The two most common rounding rules are either rounding based on a set number of decimal places or significant figures. If neither are given, it is best to round based on the number of significant figures of the numbers in the problem (typically 2-4).</p>
